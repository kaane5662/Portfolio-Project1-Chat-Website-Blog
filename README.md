# Portfolio Project 1: Chat Website
by Kaan Eren

## Context
The "Chat Website" is a website where users across the globe can come together and chat live with one another in a single chatroom(for now). This project was inspired by Discord, an instant messaging social platform targeted to gamers.

## Content

My project allows users to register accounts which the user can log in and out at anytime. Furthermore, my projects come with a bunch of customization features such as: changing the theme, profile icon, bio, and username. These blogs will walk through my process of independently studying Firebase and Javascript in order to develop my concept.

## Implications
The goal of this project was to help those specifically with time management issues, and with a lot of stress and anxiety. The project helps deal with those emotions by allowing the user to create their own personal schedule that reflects on what they do in their lifetime.
