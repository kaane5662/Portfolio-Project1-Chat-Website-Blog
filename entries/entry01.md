## Why I Want to Do This

During the 2021-2022 school year, my SEP teacher taught us the key fundementals of Javascript. SEP is a 3 year course and every year we have a big reflection project known as the, 'Freedom Project', where we were allowed to make anything we wanted, as long as we apply the stuff we learned during that year. However, the 2021-2022 Freedom project was a bit different since we were forced to use a 3rd party tool to enhance our site. The options were given by difficulty; I chose the hardest difficulty which was Firebase, 5 stars, because I love challenging myself and forcing myself to learn databases will assist my career in the future. Now that the school year is over and that I understand Firebase, it was time to put those skills to use and start a project that tests how well I know Firebase with a deadline of 2 weeks.



## Where the Idea Originated

I personally use Discord a lot as it is the platform that I mostly use to engage with my friends and colleagues. Having a lot of experience with Discord, I thought that I should try and make a clone of it, which is where the idea of the Chat-App came from. However, Discord has many features, such as direct messages, subscriptions, threads, etc; I want to keep it simple by just adding one global chat room, but enhance some customization features. As a result, to simplify things I will be adding only one chat room and not add direct messaging. One glaring flaw that I have with Discord is that you are either forced to stick with a light theme or a dark theme, so to change things up I decided the MVP will include themes. Now that I have the concept in mind it was time to start drawing some concepts for what the site was gonna look like.

## Illustrating some Concepts

To be honest, I had a hard time trying to figure out how the front-end of the website package should look like, so I went to Google to get some ideas. After looking at some photos, I went to paint.net to try and edit these photo's in order to make them look more original and not a blatant copy. After tinkering around in paint.net, I managed to come up with 5 pages: main.html, the home page; signup.html, the sign up page; login.html, the login page; index.html, the chat page; settings.htmls, the settings page. Suprisingly, I was able to keep the color scheme consistent with all the pages, meaning the pages compliment one another. 



## JsonApis/Backup

JSON API is a format that works with HTTP. It delineates how clients should request or edit data from a server, and how the server should respond to said requests. I will be using JsonApi's in order for in order to *extract/fetch* the data from Firebase into my product. This way users will immediatley be given the data they were left with when the relogin to their account, basically fetch data. 


## EDP
I am currently in stages 1 and 2 of the engineering design process: defining and researching the problem. Basically right now I am still researching the problem and visualizing what data I'm gonna store and what data I'm gonna fetch. In addition I am asking questions to my self about how will this impact the client based side along with how will this visually preload to the user when i fetch the data. Up next, I will be brainstorming possible javascript I can use to make the ability to store the data come to life. This will require thinking inside and outside the box about how to tackle this issue in a way that has been done before, but improving it and making sure the site loads in the fetches the data in a correct visually matter. So far in class, we’ve learned about the basics of Javascript, and I’m slowly realizing that the possibilities are endless with what I can create with Javacript.

## Skills
Regarding skills, I think I’m growing in learning “being creative of solving the problem” specifically toggling the issues of the client as well as giving the user an immersive experience. There is plenty of sources out there and I learned that the tools I use are beneficial to me as they can be published with Javascript. I also noticed that I can implement other backup tools since Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages out there. Basically, the more I get the hang of Javascript, the better I will be able to understand the function of these tools and implement them too my product.
